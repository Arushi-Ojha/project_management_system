## 🚀 Overview

**WAYMARK** is a modern, enterprise-ready Project Management System designed to eliminate workflow bottlenecks and deliver complete transparency across engineering and product teams. It features a strict three-tier role hierarchy, native drag-and-drop Kanban pipelines, smart workload balancing, developer deliverable review stations, and dynamic Indian Standard Time (IST) milestone status calculations.

---

## ✨ Key Features & Role Architecture

### 🛡️ 1. Administrator (Workspace Owner)
- **Workspace Creation**: Sign up organizations with 6-digit email OTP verification.
- **Basic Settings**: Create Project Managers and Employees with auto-generated `EMP-xxxx` identifiers.
- **Bulk Staff Onboarding**: Upload `.xlsx` or `.csv` spreadsheets to automatically generate secure login credentials and dispatch onboarding emails.
- **Advanced Settings**: Full CRUD operations across all database collections, strictly scoped to their organization.
- **Live Terminal Audit Logs**: Real-time terminal log viewer with exact timestamps and HTTP methods, auto-purged after 24 hours via MongoDB TTL indexes.
- **Strict Invisibility**: Administrator accounts are completely invisible to employees across project rosters and teammate listings.

### 📋 2. Project Manager (Project Head)
- **Project Head by Default**: Authorized to create projects, assign priorities, and supervise delivery (not treated as standard staff).
- **Dynamic Workflow Pipelines**: Create custom workflow stages with category tags and colors; drag-and-drop projects across pipeline columns.
- **Smart Staffing Capacity Engine**: Proactively detects and flags overloaded engineers ($\ge 3$ active tasks or $\ge 2$ concurrent projects) to prevent burnout.
- **Task Management & Reviews**: Assign tasks linked to workflows and evaluate submitted code deliverables (GitHub repositories, PR summaries, Dockerfiles).
- **Profile Customization**: Drag-and-drop square crop tool for circular avatars and secure password updates.

### 💻 3. Staff Employee
- **Focused Task Queue**: Priority-ordered task workstation sorted by deadline urgency.
- **Deliverables Submission Station**: Submit progress reports, GitHub commit/PR URLs, and Dockerfile links directly for PM approval.
- **Integrated Collaboration**: Built-in Google Meet scheduler and peer availability tracker (without visibility into Admin accounts).
- **Profile Management**: Profile picture cropping and password management.

### ⏱️ 4. Dynamic IST Progress & Deadline Engine
- Project completion percentages and statuses (`planned`, `on_track`, `at_risk`, `overdue`, `completed`) are dynamically calculated by evaluating workflow stage progression (50%), completed task deliverables (50%), and live deadline comparison against Indian Standard Time (`UTC+5:30`).

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Local Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arushi-Ojha/project_management_system.git
cd project_management_system
```

---

### 2. Backend Setup (`pms_backend`)

1. Open a terminal in the root directory and navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd pms_backend
   ```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
   - **Windows (PowerShell)**:
     ```powershell
     python -m venv venv
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
   - **Linux / macOS**:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure Environment Variables:
   Create a `.env` file inside `pms_backend/`:
   ```ini
   # Database Configuration
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
   DB_NAME=pms_db

   # Security
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_change_in_production

   # SMTP Email Settings (For OTP verification and credential dispatch)
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
   ```

5. Start the FastAPI Development Server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```
   The backend API will be running live at **`http://127.0.0.1:8000`**.
   - **Interactive Swagger Documentation**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
   - **ReDoc Documentation**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)

---

### 3. Frontend Setup (`pms_frontend`)

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd pms_frontend
   ```

2. Install Node dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Vite Development Server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend web application will be available at **`http://localhost:5173`**.

4. (Optional) Build for Production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy Highlights

1. **Role Invisibility**: Non-admin users cannot query or view administrative account profiles or contact data.
2. **Auto-Purging TTL Logs**: MongoDB automatically deletes terminal logs after 24 hours (`expireAfterSeconds=86400`) and notifications after 7 days.
3. **Password Security**: Passwords are encrypted using salted Bcrypt before storage; plain passwords are never logged or stored.
4. **JWT Expiry**: Sessions are secured via signed JWT tokens with automated expiration validation.
